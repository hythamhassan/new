            <p id="p"> In adding the dome to the Florence Cathedral (Italy) in the early 15th century, 
                the architect Filippo Brunelleschi not only transformed the building and the city, 
                but also the role and status of the architect.[1][2]</p>

The Duomo Terraces
In 1439, to strengthen the stability of the Cathedral dome, Brunelleschi conceived the so-called "Tribune Morte" at the base of the drum, which are masterpieces of Renaissance architecture. The way to the Terraces of Santa Maria del Fiore begins right inside the Dead North Tribune.

The Cathedral Terraces are located at the height of the rooftops of the side aisles (about 32m). They consist of a continuous balcony on corbels decorated with a perforated marble balustrade, which looks very similar to that of the Bell Tower on the upper level. Along the North and South Terraces, currently practicable and about 70m long each, it is possible to have a close-up view of the rose windows marble coating and the main nave cladding. Here is also quite remarkable the presence of putlog holes and the brick roofs of the side aisles under which some hidden rooms of the Cathedral remain.

Some curious illustrious guests may have passed through the Terraces over time, but their main function was as a path to be used by the workers involved in the maintenance of the Cathedral, as it still happens today; it is only since 1985 that the Terraces have been open to the public.

Since the old times some terracota basins have always been displayed along the path to collect the rainwater, which is useful for the conservation and restoration works carried out on site as well as to prevent the tiles deterioration.
